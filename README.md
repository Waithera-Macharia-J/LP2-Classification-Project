##### TOPIC: `Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Strategies for Vodafone Corporation`
 
`Project Understanding and Description:`
Inorder for Telco companies to grow their revenue generating base, it is important for them to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (known as churn). In the real world different reasons cause customers to terminate their contracts, for example; better price offers and more interesting packages from competitors, bad service experiences with current provider or change of customersâ€™ personal preferences and situations.
 
`Project Objective:`
Our objective in this project based on the data provided, is to leverage machine learning models to predict customer churn within Vodafone Corporation, a leading telecommunication company. Customer churn or the loss of customers over time, is a critical concern and understanding the factors influencing churn can inform proactive retention strategies for our client.
 
Our task is to train machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take counter measures such as discounts, special offers or other gratifications to keep their customers. A customer churn analysis is a typical classification problem within the domain of supervised learning.
 
In this project, a basic machine learning pipeline based on a sample data set from Kaggle is build and performance of different model types is compared. The pipeline used for this example consists of 8 steps:
 
Step 1: Problem Definition
 
Step 2: Data Collection
 
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 
Step 4: Feature Engineering
 
Step 5: Train/Test Split
 
Step 6: Model Evaluation Metrics Definition
 
Step 7: Model Selection, Training, Prediction and Assessment
 
Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning/Model Improvement
 
`Key Components:`
 
`Data Collection and Exploration:`
 
Gather and explore data provided by the marketing and sales teams, encompassing customer demographics, service usage, and historical churn records.
 
`Hypothesis Formation:`
 
Develop hypotheses around potential factors influencing customer churn, considering aspects such as contract duration, service-related issues, pricing, billing preferences, and customer demographics.
 
 
`Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:`

`Model Building:`
Select and train machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data.
 
 
`Evaluation and Key Indicators:`
Evaluate the models' performance and identify key indicators contributing to customer churn.
 
 
`Retention Strategies:`
Collaborate with business development, marketing, and sales teams to derive actionable insights from the models and formulate effective retention strategies.
 
 
`Model Deployment and Integration:`
Deploy the trained models into Vodafone's systems for real-time or batch predictions, integrating them seamlessly into the business processes.
 
 
`Documentation and Reporting:`
Document the entire data science process, including preprocessing steps, model selection, and deployment procedures. Provide clear and concise reports on model performance, key indicators, and recommended retention strategies.
 
 
`Continuous Improvement:`
Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement, iterating on models and strategies based on real-world feedback and evolving business dynamics.
By the end of this project, we aim to equip Vodafone Corporation with predictive capabilities to anticipate customer churn and implement targeted retention measures, ultimately fostering customer satisfaction and business sustainability.
 
`Hypothesis Formation:`Customers with shorter contract durations are more likely to churn due to lower commitment.
 
`Null Hypothesis:`
There is no significant difference in the likelihood of churn between customers with shorter contract durations and those with longer contract durations.
 
`Alternative Hypothesis:`
Customers with shorter contract durations are more likely to churn compared to customers with longer contract durations.

`Hypothesis Questions:`
 
`Question 1:`
How does the length of a customer's contract term correlate with the likelihood of churn?
 
 
`Question 2:` What is the distribution of contract durations among customers who have churned compared to those who have not?
 
`Question 3:`Are there noticeable differences in churn rates between customers with short-term (month-to-month) contracts and those with long-term contracts?
 
`Question 4:`How does the average tenure of customers who churn compare to the average tenure of customers who remain with Vodafone?
 
`EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS OF PROVIDED DATA:`
 
Import Relevant Libraries and Modules:
 
Import necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.
Cleaning of Data:
 
Handle missing values (if any).
Check for duplicate records and remove them.
Address outliers in numerical columns.
Check Data Types:
 
Ensure that each column has the correct data type.
Convert categorical variables to the appropriate data type.
Encoding Data Labels:
 
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Convert binary categorical variables (Yes/No) to 1/0.
 
`Question 5:`Are there specific patterns or trends in customer behavior leading to churn within the initial months of contract initiation?
 
`Question 6:`What proportion of customers with short contract durations opts for additional services such as tech support, online security, or premium features, and does this impact their likelihood to churn?

COMBINE DATA SETS
 
Before combining datasets in Python, there are several crucial steps to consider to ensure that the combination is done accurately and meaningfully. Here are the key steps:
 
Understand the Datasets:
 
Have a clear understanding of the structure, format, and content of the datasets you are working with. This includes knowing the types of variables, data types, and the presence of any unique identifiers.
Check for Consistency:
 
Ensure that the datasets have a consistent format, meaning similar column names, data types, and units. Consistency is crucial for meaningful combination.
 
Handling Missing Values:
 
Assess and handle missing values in each dataset appropriately. Decide whether to impute missing values, remove rows or columns with missing values, or keep them based on the analysis goals.
Address Data Quality Issues:
 
Identify and address any data quality issues, such as outliers or incorrect values. Cleaning the datasets individually before combination is essential for accurate results.
Check for Duplicates:
 
Examine both datasets for duplicate rows or entries. Address any duplicates before combining, as they can affect the integrity of the combined dataset.
Ensure Compatibility:
 
Check that the data types of corresponding columns are compatible for combination. For example, ensure that numeric columns have the same data types in both datasets.
Handling Categorical Variables:
 
If the datasets contain categorical variables, make sure that the categories are consistent between the datasets. Consider creating dummy variables or encoding categorical variables as needed.
Check for Unique Identifiers:
 
Identify unique identifiers or key columns in each dataset that can be used for merging. Ensure that these identifiers are present and have the same values in both datasets.
Explore Common Columns:
 
Understand the common columns that can be used for merging. These columns should represent similar information across datasets and act as keys for the merge operation.
Select the Appropriate Merge Method:
 
Choose the appropriate merge method (e.g., inner join, outer join, left join, right join) based on the desired outcome and the relationship between the datasets.
Handle Renaming if Necessary:
 
If there are conflicting column names between datasets, decide whether to rename the columns to avoid conflicts during the merge operation.
Backup Data:
 
Before performing any merging or combination, consider creating a backup of the original datasets to avoid accidental loss of data.
Explore Combined Dataset:
 
After merging, explore the combined dataset to ensure that the merge operation was successful and that the resulting dataset meets your analysis requirements.
Perform Further Analysis:
 
Once the datasets are combined, proceed with further analysis, visualization, or modeling based on the objectives of your project.
By following these steps, you can enhance the reliability and accuracy of the combined dataset, ensuring that it is well-prepared for subsequent analysis or modeling tasks.
 
Model Building & Selection
Building a model in machine learning is creating a mathematical representation by generalizing and learning from training data. The built model is applied to new data to make predictions and obtain results.
 
After building a variety of models, we compare our models and select our best-performing model based on certain criteria.
 
Model selection is the process of selecting one final machine learning model from among a collection of candidate machine learning models for a training dataset.
 
Model selection is important because the choice of model can have a significant impact on the accuracy of predictions made by the model. For example, a more complex model may be more accurate than a simpler model, but it may also be more difficult to train and more expensive to run.
